### Word Guess Game

Welcome to this node command line word guess game.  Clone the repo to your machine and open it in a code editor.  Run `npm install` to install the dependencies to run the game.  Then, by running `node index.js` you will be asked to play.  Answer Y/N.  While playing, simply choose a letter to guess and you will see "Correct!" or "Incorrect!" as well as a visual representation of the blanks left in the word.  Spell the word to win, seven incorrect guesses and you lose.
